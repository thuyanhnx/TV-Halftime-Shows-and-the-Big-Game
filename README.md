# TV-Halftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game
Load, clean, and explore Super Bowl data in the age of soaring ad costs and flashy halftime shows.

### Description
This is a project from DataCamp

Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The halftime shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding a giant mechanical tiger or leaping from the roof of the stadium.

In this project, you will find out how some of the elements interact with each other.

1. What are the most extreme game outcomes?
2. How does point difference affect television viewership?
3. How have viewership, TV ratings, and advertisement costs evolved?
4. Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset used in this Project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
